- [Weather Observation Station 5](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5/problem?isFullScreen=false)

`select city with the city name with the maximum length and minimun length of its name(if there are multiple then select a laxiographicaly the first one only)`

####  Approach:
1.  Select the the first one with the minimum length from in `assending` order

2.  Select the first one with the maximum length from `assending` order

3.  Union them using `union all` 

```
(SELECT city,
        Length(city)
 FROM   station
 HAVING Length(city) = (SELECT Min(Length(city))
                        FROM   station)
 ORDER  BY city
 LIMIT  1)
UNION ALL
(SELECT city,
        Length(city)
 FROM   station
 HAVING Length(city) = (SELECT Max(Length(city))
                        FROM   station)
 ORDER  BY city
 LIMIT  1);
